### What I learned

During the process of writing the code, i had a major problem, which was centering the "seection". I knew the "align-item" is used for centering your content . I tried that , but it still didn't work. I got fustrated and i decided to go online for help or solution.
And that how i figured what i was getting wrong. I learned you have to declare the height of the page so that to set a boundary.

```css
section{
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
} 

### Useful resources
